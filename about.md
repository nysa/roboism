# About

Roboism is a podcast about robots and feminism, but mostly robots.

### Hosts

Alex Cox makes documentaries and has a lot of opinions about robots. Savannah Million is a designer / developer and looks forward to the AI apocalypse.

Alex and Savannah work out of the same co-working space. In the summer of 2015, they discovered a mutual love of robots, and figured the world ought to know. Thus, Roboism happened.

Shortly after launch, Roboism joined the Chicago Podcast Cooperative and have been happily affiliated ever since.
