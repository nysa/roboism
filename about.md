# About

Roboism is a podcast about robots, technology, and feminism, but mostly robots.

### Hosts

Alex and Savannah work out of the same co-working space. In the summer of 2015, they discovered a mutual love of robots, and figured the world ought to know. Thus, we have Roboism.

Shortly after launch, Roboism joined the Chicago Podcast Cooperative and have been happily affiliated ever since.
